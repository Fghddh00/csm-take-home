Thank you for reaching out about best practices for redirects! Setting up redirects correctly is essential for a seamless user experience and maintaining strong SEO performance. Here are some tips to help:

	1.	Use Vercel’s Built-in Redirects
Vercel makes managing redirects simple through the vercel.json configuration file or directly in the dashboard. These redirects happen at the edge, ensuring they’re fast and reliable for your users.
	2.	301 Redirects for Permanent Changes
For pages that have permanently moved to a new URL, use 301 redirects. These inform search engines about the permanent change and help preserve your SEO rankings.
	3.	302 Redirects for Temporary Moves
If the redirect is temporary—like during maintenance or A/B testing—use a 302 redirect. This tells search engines the original URL will return in the future.
	4.	Avoid Redirect Chains
Minimize redirect chains (e.g., A → B → C). Instead, redirect directly from A → C. This improves page speed and helps SEO.
	5.	Set Up HTTPS Redirects
If you’re moving from HTTP to HTTPS, make sure to redirect all traffic from the HTTP version to the secure HTTPS version to protect your users.
	6.	Use Edge Middleware for Dynamic Redirects
For more advanced scenarios, like personalized redirects, Edge Middleware is a great option. It lets you run custom code at the edge for redirects tailored to user data or other dynamic conditions.
	7.	Test Thoroughly
Before deploying, test all redirects to make sure they work as intended. Tools like browser developer tools or online redirect checkers can be handy here.
	8.	Monitor Redirect Performance
After implementation, use Vercel’s analytics to track how your redirects are performing and identify any potential issues.
	9.	Review and Update Regularly
Keep your redirects up to date by removing outdated ones and maintaining only those that are relevant.
	10.	Document Your Redirects
Maintain clear documentation of all redirects for your team. This will make future updates or troubleshooting much easier.

By following these steps, you’ll ensure your redirects are efficient, maintain SEO value, and create a smooth experience for your users. If you need help setting these up or have any specific questions, feel free to reach out—we’re happy to assist!
