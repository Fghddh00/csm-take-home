      <h2>
      Thanks for reaching out about monitoring and logging options for your Vercel project! Here are some great third-party integrations to consider:
</h2>

<ul>1.	Sentry: Tracks errors and monitors performance in real time, helping you quickly identify and resolve issues.</ul>
<ul>2.	LogRocket: Provides session replays and logging, making it easy to reproduce bugs by seeing what users experienced.</ul>
<ul>3.	Datadog: Offers comprehensive stack monitoring and analytics with real-time visibility into performance.</ul>
<ul>4.	New Relic: A robust all-in-one solution for application and infrastructure monitoring.</ul>
<ul>5.	Papertrail: Simplifies logging with real-time aggregation and search capabilities for easier troubleshooting.</ul>

<h2>
These tools integrate seamlessly with Vercel, either via the dashboard or by adding their SDKs to your project. They work well with serverless and edge functions, providing insights into both frontend and backend performance.

When choosing a solution, think about your specific needs, like the level of detail required, budget, or additional features such as error tracking. I would love to set up some time to know about your specific situation to give you a more tailored recommendation!
